git is kinda cool ngl
its like codespaces but better and makes slightly more sense actually

less live tho

remember to commit then push 

cuz i have no clue how this works at ALL. this is my first time trying this shit 

Note that this is HARD-CODED for my PC. i can try and fix that. This relies on LonelyScreen for iphone screen capture.
